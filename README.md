Testimoni

"So I just failed the CSA Pro 2019 exam and I'm taking another shot at it. One of the questions that stuck in my mind was about 3 VPCs peered together (B & C to A). VPC B and VPC C have overlapping CIDRs. I am pretty sure this is the exact image used from the exam - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/images/one-to-two-vpcs-lpm-diagram.png

(That image is from here, near the bottom - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/peering-configurations-partial-access.html)

So the situation involved only needing to route from VPC A to VPC B to get to the one instance, but still needing access to all of VPC C .

I totally guess at the answer, I think I picked an answer that mentioned a specific route for the instance in VPC B? I am not very strong in this area, if it isn't obvious. Even reading over the AWS documentation is just confusing to me. I think the documentation tells me that I picked the right answer since I only remember one answer mentioning a specific route for the instance in VPC B.
